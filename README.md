This is a Discord bot (tag is Activity Bot#0423) developed for the Shrouded Gaming Community.
Its main purpose is to provide data on the Discord and in-game Destiny 2 activity of the members of the SGC for use in activity tracking spreadsheets and ensuring that members remain active.
  The bot does this by first cycling through all the channels it has access to and tracking each member that has messaged within the activity threshold timeframe.
  Once complete, it queries the Bungie API and then pulls the rosters of all the Destiny clans.
  It then attempts to match users as best as it can through Discord and Bungie names.
  Finally, it uploads the completed sheets into the 3 separate activity sheets for PC, PS4, and Xbox.
It also performs some miscellaneous functions, such as creating activity leaderboards and checking the Discord activity of one channel.
Features will continue to be added.
